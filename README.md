# League of Legends: What is the Best Champion?

## Introduction
### Introduction and Question Identification
What is the best champion in the game? That is every gamers' first question they start playing a game to have an easy and enjoyable time. Even experienced players' ask this same question to maximize their success in the game. The game we will be analyzing today is League of Legends, a multiplayer online battle arena video game where 2 teams of five battle it out in an all out skirmish to see who can destroy the enemy's nexus. The first one who destroys the opposing team's nexus wins. The dataset we have here has 149400 rows and the main columns we want to mainly focus on today are the champion, position, result, and kills columns. Champion: the name of character, position: the role played, result: win or lost, and kills: the amount of individual takedowns.
